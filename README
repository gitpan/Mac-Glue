THIS IS BETA CODE.

Please read this README.  Mac::Glue is not self-explanatory.  Some
assembly is required.


WHAT THIS IS
- ------------

It is an architecture for using Apple event terminology in MacPerl.
It is cool.
It is in beta.  Yay!


GETTING STARTED
- ---------------

You need the latest cpan-mac installed.  It is cpan-mac 0.32,
and available at:

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/CNANDOR/

Read the cpan-mac README for more information on it.  It contains
all the modules you will need to use Mac::Glue (including
some other really cool stuff).

If you have installed the previous Mac::Glue distribution
from 990622 SINCE installing cpan-mac 0.32, you will need to
reinstall cpan-mac 0.32, as Mac::Glue 990622 probably overwrote
newer versions with older versions of some modules.  That's life
using alpha code!  :D

Make sure in your Preferences, set site_perl as a libraries
path (so it will come before your main MacPerl lib directory).

Drop the Mac-Glue archive, or the unpacked folder, on the
installme droplet that came with cpan-mac.

After installing, you need to run the gluedialect program and then the
gluescriptadds program.

Then, for each application you want to script, drop it on the gluemac
droplet.  Applications should not be running, in general, when dropped
on the droplet (though in some cases it will work anyway, and in some
cases the droplet will launch the application for you to get the
needed information).  First program you should drop on the droplet is
probably the Finder.  For each example script in this distribution you
want to try, run the applications through the droplet first.


PLAYING
- -------

Read the history in Mac:Glue.pm for what's changed, and read the code
for the examples in ex/.

Please play and read the notes and feed back to macperl-modules (see
http://www.macperl.org/ for more details).  Feel free to send any
feedback, including patches, to the list.
