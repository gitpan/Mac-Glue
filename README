THIS IS BETA CODE.  BUT NOT FOR LONG.

Please read this README.  Mac::Glue is not self-explanatory.  Some
assembly is required.


WHAT THIS IS
------------

Mac::Glue 0.57.
It is an architecture for using Apple event terminology in MacPerl.
It is cool.
It is in beta.  Yay!


GETTING STARTED, PART ONE
-------------------------

You need the latest cpan-mac installed.  It is cpan-mac 0.40,
and available at:

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/CNANDOR/

Read the cpan-mac README for more information on it.  It contains
all the modules you will need to use Mac::Glue (including
some other really cool stuff).

************************************************************************
Make sure that in your MacPerl Preferences you set site_perl as a
Libraries path (so it will come before your main MacPerl lib directory).
************************************************************************

You should also download the latest Mac::AppleEvents::Simple, which is
currently version 0.81.

NOTE: This distribution contains Mac::Processes 1.01, for launching apps
by their path and getting the right Process Serial Number. The module
will be included in a future cpan-mac distribution, and then a future
MacPerl distribution.


GETTING STARTED, PART TWO
--------------------------

Drop the Mac-Glue archive, or the unpacked folder, on the
installme droplet that came with cpan-mac.

After installing, you need to run the gluedialect program and then the
gluescriptadds program.  These can be run just by double-clicking.

Then, for each application you want to script, drop it on the gluemac
droplet.  Applications should not be running, in general, when dropped
on the droplet (though in some cases it will work anyway, and in some
cases the droplet will launch the application for you to get the
needed information).  First program you should drop on the droplet is
probably the Finder.  For each example script in this distribution you
want to try, run the applications through the droplet first.


PLAYING
-------

Read the history in Mac:Glue.pm for what's changed, and read the code
for the examples in ex/.

Please play and read the notes and feed back to macperl-modules (see
http://www.macperl.org/ for more details).  Feel free to send any
feedback, including patches, to the list.
