This is Mac::Glue, for using Apple events with AppleScript vocabulary.

See HISTORY in the POD for changes.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://sf.net/projects/mac-glue/
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/CNANDOR/

Please read this README and the POD documentation.  Mac::Glue is not
self-explanatory.  Some assembly is required.  Mac::Glue comes with
MacPerl 5.6.1 and later.


GETTING STARTED, PART ONE
-------------------------

If not using MacPerl 5.6.1 or greater, the cpan-mac distribution (or
the equivalent) is required.  It is available at:

    http://sf.net/projects/cpan-mac/
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/CNANDOR/

Read the cpan-mac README for more information on it.  It contains
all the modules you will need to use Mac::Glue (including
some other really cool stuff), most notably Mac::AppleEvents::Simple
and some updated versions of other Mac:: modules.

************************************************************************
Make sure that in your MacPerl Preferences you set site_perl as a
Libraries path (so it will come before your main MacPerl lib directory).
This is not necessary for MacPerl 5.6.1 and greater.
************************************************************************


GETTING STARTED, PART TWO
--------------------------

If the module is not already installed, drop the Mac-Glue archive, or
the unpacked folder, on the installme droplet that came with cpan-mac
(or with MacPerl itself).

After installing, you need to run the gluedialect program and then the
gluescriptadds program.  These can be run just by double-clicking.

Then, for each application you want to script, drop it on the gluemac
droplet.  Applications should not be running, in general, when dropped
on the droplet (though in some cases it will work anyway, and in some
cases the droplet will launch the application for you to get the
needed information).  The first program you should drop on the droplet is
probably the Finder.  For each example script in this distribution you
want to try, run the applications through the droplet first.


PLAYING

Read the history in Mac:Glue.pm for what's changed, and read the code
for the examples in ex/.

Please play and read the notes and feed back to the lists, bug reporting,
patch manager, or forums on SourceForge.


Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.
