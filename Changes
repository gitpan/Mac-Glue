* v1.10, May 13, 2003

   Major update for Mac OS X support.

   Added various path handling/coercion for Mac OS X.

   Added support for making glues on Mac OS X, with bundles and apps
   without creator IDs.

   Added support for targetting apps without creator IDs (they are
   launched, then targetted by PSN).

   Use $MacError instead of $^E ($^E still works in MacPerl scripts).

   Added APPNAME key to glue objects, with name of the application.

   Added fun debugging junk with "_print_aes" object hash key.

   Refactored some code for scripts, moved out to Mac::Glue::Common.

   Command-line-ized the "droplets" in scripts/.

   Renamed and reorganized example scripts in ex/.
   

* v1.02, May 7, 2002

   Skip directories when opening dialect/OSAX glues.

* v1.01, January 15, 2002

   Clean up a bit for 5.6.

   Add ADDRESS method.

   Add checking for enumerators and classes.

   Make error handler work as hashref parameter list.

   Change license to be that of Perl.


* v1.00, September 12, 2000

   Added error handling via ERRORS parameter / method.

   General cleanup, additional examples.

* v0.58, November 16, 1999

   Change all of the classes to have Mac:: at the beginning of them
   (except for ones that originate elsewhere, like AEDesc, et al).

   Added Mac::AEParamType and param_type.

   If a parameter expects an AE object specifier record, and is not passed
   one, then it guesses the type and sets it to either typeChar or
   typeInteger.

   Made the conversion of keys into English names recursive with lists,
   in addition to records (i.e., lists can contain multiple records).


* v0.57, November 2, 1999

   Added conversion of keys in returned records back into the "English"
   names.

   Records containing "class" parameter are coerced into descriptors
   of that class (i.e., { name => 'foo', class => 'disk' }).

   Added support for events over TCP/IP (Mac OS 9 required).

   Note: if Keychain Access is used in Mac OS 9, the login() method may
   no longer be required for accessing of remote machines.

   Fixed bug in can() method; also changed how can() calls AUTOLOAD().

   Added code for experimental callback stuff, undocumented,
   subject to change, and probably does not even work.

   Changed _get_name to _get_id, created new _get_name.

   Updated dialect creation code for Mac OS 9 (aeut is now stored in
   the AppleScript extension instead of a dialect file, but for
   Mac::Glue is still stored in the dialects folder.  Instead
   of being called English, it will likely be called AppleScript.
   You should delete (or archive) old dialect glues manually.


* v0.56, September 10, 1999

   If plural class is used (i.e., files for file), and the following
   value is not an AE* object, then it will become "every 'class'".
   (Jeff Lowrey)

   Added more documentation about using AEObjDesc objects.  (Jeff Lowrey)

* v0.55, September 2, 1999

   Added extra arguments to new() to accept alternate targets.  PPC ports,
   PSNs, and paths are explicitly accepted now.  (Paths are first launched,
   then the PSN is found ... aliases won't work properly as paths.)

   Added login() class method to tell MacPerl to try logging in
   with specified username and password.  Requires "Login As"
   OSAX from the GTQ Scripting Library.

* v0.51, September 1, 1999

   Changed ordering of search in _find_event.

   Fixed doc problems in Mac::AETE::Format::Glue: inheritance
   classes are named, and optional parameters are properly
   denoted.

* v0.50, July 12, 1999

   Added g* constants in addition to glue* constants.  Use whichever
   you like, but I will use g* for everything.  If you don't want the
   g* constants, because they conflict with something, use the
   ":long" and ":longall" import tags instead of ":glue" and ":all".

   Gone to beta!  Woo!

* v0.31, June 22, 1999

   Fixed bug that only found class names instead of class and property
   names in creation of object specifier records.

   Fixed bug which changed directories on initialization, and didn't change
   it back.

   Allow case-insensitive parameter names.

* v0.30, June 16, 1999

   Changed function names: glueInsertion() is now location(),
   glueRange() is now range().

   Added whose() function.

   Added can() method which correctly finds available events.

   Made special parameters, formerly with leading underscore and lowercase,
   to all uppercase with no underscore (i.e., _retobj is now RETOBJ).

   Added "of" and "in" as synonyms for "property" in obj() method calls.

   Put AEObjDesc back in!  Will use in the future, maybe, to use objects
   as targets for events.

   Return all descriptors from obj() and prop(), and all objects
   returned from events, as AEObjDesc objects.

   Added glueTrue and glueFalse constants.

   Tried again to suppress warnings during initial scripting additions and
   dialect creation.

   Tons of internal cleaning up.

* v0.26, June 7, 1999

   Made choice of serializer for glue more intelligent: FreezeThaw
   automatically picked for CFM68K, Storable for PPC.

   Updated Mac::AppleEvents and Mac::Memory, fixed more bugs and
   added constants.  Fixed bug in AutoSplit.

   Added glueInsertion(), glueRange(), and glueNull().

   Completely removed AEObjDesc package, which existed to support
   destruction of descriptors.  Use global hash now to keep track
   of descriptors to destroy (Mac::AppleEvents::Simple).  So
   all descriptors returned from obj() and prop() and others are
   AEDesc objects.

   Changed ordering of items in creating object specifiers in
   _do_obj to match AppleScript, so comparing to Capture AE
   output would be easier.

   Put %AE_PUT back in Mac::Glue and left %AE_GET in
   Mac::AppleEvents::Simple.

   Switched DOBJ => { PARAM1 => DATA1 } to DOBJ => PARAM1 => DATA1
   in event calls.

   Always default to wait for reply and no timeout if unspecified by user.

   Return useful errors in $^E.

   Accept and return nested arrays/lists and hashes/records.

   Call events and pass classes / properties case-insensitively.

   Other miscellaneous changes.  Some cleaning up.

* v0.25, May 30, 1999

   Add serializer option.

   Updates to Mac::Memory and Mac::AppleEvents and Mac::AppleEvents::Simple.

   Added constants for absolute and relative positions.

   Added enum().

   Put o() and p() back as obj() and prop().

   Other miscellaneous changes.  Lots of cleaning up.

* v0.20, May 22, 1999

   Complete rewrite.  Too many changes to bother mentioning, because
   I am lazy.

* v0.09, October 13, 1998

   Added ability to use properties.  These are called with the p() method:

      $obj->get( $obj->p('label_index', item => 'HD') );

   which is equivalent to:

      $obj->get( $obj->o(property => 'label_index', item => 'HD') );

* v0.08, October 10, 1998

   Unreleased.

   Significant cleanup of module, in large part unfinished changes from
   last version.

   No longer doing error checking for whether lists are allowed or objects
   are allowed, because these are sometimes wrong or undetectable.  Also,
   will not raise exception on a missing required parameter, but will warn
   if -w is on.

   obj_form is exported from the glue modules, and all of the functions
   and constant from Mac::AppleEvents can be imported from a glue module
   with the ":all" tag:

      use Mac::Glue::SomeApp qw(:all);

* v0.07, September 30, 1998

   More documentation and bugfixes.  Having serious problems with
   AEObjDesc::DESTROY.

* v0.06, September 29, 1998

   Whole bunches of changes.  Note that glues made under 0.05 no longer work.
