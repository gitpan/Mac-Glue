Remember that you first need to create glues for each app you script.  If you
don't have the app, you can't run gluemac on it, and can't script it.

SimpleText is not scripted with a glue, it is just opened with
Mac::Apps::Launch and scripted with PreFab Player.  Drop the
PreFab Player extension on the glue droplet.

URL Access is found in Scripting Additions in Mac OS 8.6.

Mac OS X: several of these examples don't work in Mac OS X, as they require
apps or scripting additions found in Mac OS, or perform actions that do
not work in Mac OS X (such as setting the label of an item on the Desktop,
which is not implemented, or pulling files out of the System Folder, which
doesn't exit).

The examples that do not work on Mac OS X:

	bettertelnet_login
	dialog_director_more_lists
	dialog_director_stuff
	eudora_make_hidden
	finder_clean_up
	finder_get_system_folder_files
	finder_label_and_beep
	finder_label_and_beep_cool_version
	progress_bar_stuff
	sherlock_search_drive
	sherlock_search_internet
	simple_text_and_prefab_player

Mac OS X-only examples:

	address_book
